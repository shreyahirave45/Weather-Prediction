# Weather-Prediction
The **Weather Prediction** project uses machine learning to predict temperature based on synthetic weather data. It tests models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to find the best one. The goal is to predict temperature accurately. This project shows how machine learning can improve weather forecasting.
